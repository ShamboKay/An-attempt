# An-attempt

I wanted to try make a stick man jumping just for a basic "game"

I have not been able to figure it out at all, I am trying my best to not watch a video on this.

I have been trying to search it but it is not working out for me.

I don't know what I have even made.

I feel tired when I come home from work and I really want to learn to code and yesterday I took a break and felt so bad for doing so. 

I do not want to do breaks. I want to do it everyday but I set goals of 4hrs per day and 8hrs over the weekends. Should I really be putting this much time into it while I almost feel burntout after my first week?
